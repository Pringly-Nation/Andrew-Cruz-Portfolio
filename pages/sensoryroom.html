        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>The Curtin Accessibility Officer, Filiz has issued my group of multi-disciplinary students a challenge to convince Curtin to install sensory rooms for autistic and overstimulated students within a week's worth of time.</p>

        <h1>Contribution</h1>
        <p>While my group worked on the proposal portion of the brief, I was tasked with creating a VR experience in Unity to better illustrate what a multi-sensory room might look like 
          in an immersive environment.

      <section id="research">
        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>With only having 3d modeling experience and limited Unreal engine experience, research quickly became how to create a VR experience quickly and effectively. 
          This is where Unity comes in, with their quick drag and drop commands to create some interactivity within the scene. Within five days, I was able to create a peaceful and calming environment
          that is fully playable on the VR headset.

          <h3>VR functionality</h3>
          <p>Users are able to look and move through the experience in VR goggles and pick up blue-tinted objects with their controllers.</p>

        <div class="main-design-information">
        <h3>Warm and inviting atmosphere</h3>
        <p>While time was a factor for not texturing the 3d models, I used the Unity light feature to cast a warm yellow on the furniture to create a warm environment to relax in.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="main-design-information">
        <h3>Calm music design</h3>
        <p>Putting my music background into good use, I was able to create a calm and soothing Lo-fi Hip Hop track to accompany the user as they move through the experience.</p>
