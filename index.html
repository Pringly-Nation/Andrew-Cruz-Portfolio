            <p class="desc"> Airborne airlines is a website for flyers who put luxury first rather than convenience. 
            Airborne Airlines is a website that was created in collaboration with my mentor, Benjamin Loh. The two of us met up and discussed different design thinking that ultimately created the Airborne Airlines Website.

            <p class="desc">The Candy Carousel Multimodal Interaction display is a 3d object that users can interact with their body in a sort of futuristic and sci-fi type of way.
              Incorporating new principles such as hands and space, body and display to fully immerse the human body to set the display apart from regular, old and boring touch screen displays, which still has it’s purpose in this day and age.
              But the future is now.

            <p class="desc">Shark’s Fin website is a website that pays love to my love of sharks and the preservation of their species in our oceans.

            <p class="desc">The Street Kings website is the dipping of my toe into the frontend development but also the backend development of a website. It is a car selling website that uses the underground Tokyo car scene as it’s influence and background
              The website incorporates a full stack development approach used to send information back and forth from the user to the database to retrieve information.
